# Spanish lyrics dataset for LGBTQ+phobia screening

## Overview
The corpus developed for this task is composed of songs written in Spanish that may contain LGBTQ+phobic text or not (non-phobic). LGBTQ+phobia in the corpus can be identified in two different ways:
1. **Directly**: Through the use of textual terminology, slang, and general slurs to refer to members of the LGBTQ+ community.
2. **Indirectly**: By using semantic relationships. Typically, this involves metaphors where lyrics convey a figurative meaning beyond their literal interpretation.

## Compilation Method
The initial compilation of the corpus was done without considering the content of the songs. The criteria for identifying phobic content included:
- **List of Nouns**: Specific nouns that might denote LGBTQ+phobic sentiments.
- **Inflections**: This includes diminutives and augmentatives which might alter the meaning of the words to be phobic.
- **Slang**: Commonly used slang that may contain or imply LGBTQ+phobic connotations.

## Structure
The corpus is structured to aid in the detection and study of both direct and indirect LGBTQ+phobic content in Spanish song lyrics.

## Usage
Researchers and developers can use this corpus to:
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for detecting LGBTQ+phobic content.
- Study the linguistic features associated with LGBTQ+phobic texts.
- Develop tools and applications to identify and mitigate the spread of LGBTQ+phobia in media and texts.
